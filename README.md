# Sort-Author-and-Date
I created my python panda name Sort.ipynb. the source that I got is from this website, https://www.kaggle.com/ryanxjhan/cbc-news-coronavirus-articles-march-26?select=news.csv.
Avash Kharel is the product owner. As a product owner Avash wanted to me to sort out the date and group the author from the source I mentioned before.Furthermore, He requested me to display all the columns.
